## What is the Memory Game

This is a simple game built using Vanilla JavaScript.
the game shuffles cards and user should be able to match similar cards.

## Challenge

- find all three bugs and solve them.

## Instructions

- Click on a card
- Keep revealing cards and working your memory to remember each Card Place .
- Match cards properly with less moves and in faster time , The Faster you do The Higer Score you Get .
- Game is using CSS classes like (match - open - show - disabled - no-event-unmatched)
- cards are matched when they have the same type
- cards are unmatched when they have different types
- cards are disabled when they are matched
- cards are shown when they are clicked
- cards are hidden when they are not Matched
- Game complete when all cards are matched.

## How I built the Memory Game

- created a deck of cards that shuffles when game is refreshed
- created a counter that count the number of moves made by player and timer to know for your Score Time .
- added animations to cards when they match and are unmatched
- create a pop-up modal when player wins game .
- Game Reset when player press Play Again .
